      'Enthusiasm to Learn' defines me in a nutshell. Aiming towards a goal and
      making continuous effort to achieve it is what I believe. I am a girl who
      puts thinking into each step towards giving back to the community by
      sharing the knowledge with everyone who is in the quest for it. Hardwork
      and Determination are the two values that I hold close to my heart.
      Working as a Software Engineer, I have keen interest in working on new
      technologies. Being the Gold facilitator of the #IamRemarkable initiative
      by Google, I always give my best to motivate my people around me.
      Empowering women and having gender equity has always been my motive and
      this led me to be the Chapter Lead for Malikah where I will be helping
      women out in many ways. Despite busy schedules, I never miss an
      opportunity to travel and eat. I belong to a middle class family from
      Ballia, Uttar Pradesh and have done my schooling from Uttar Pradesh. Like
      all other students, I had a dream to go to IIT, but destiny had other
      plans for me and I landed in Lovely Professional University to pursue my
      dream of becoming an engineer. The four years of my college life was full
      of fun, learning, hosting workshops/sessions on behalf of GDG Jalandhar
      and ended with a one-year Internship with iBHubs alongwith my fourth year
      of B.Tech. GDG Jalandhar has played the most important role in my life. It
      helped me in enhancing my technical stack know-how along with making me
      comfortable and confident in communicating with others. I started my
      journey as an attendee in DevFest Jalandhar 2015 and it gradually took me
      to being an Organizer and Women Techmakers Ambassador of the chapter.
      After spending almost an year in the southern part of India, I chose to
      work in the National Capital, Delhi and got an offer from Edfora Infotech
      to work as a SDE for the product myPAT (then) and Watson (now). I have
      sucessfully conducted 230+ workshops on behalf of GDG Jalandhar and
      actively contributing for the betterment of the community since the last 4
      years.
